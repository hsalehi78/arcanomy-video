# Arcanomy Reels — Beat Sheet Guide (Script → Edit) v1.0
_Last updated: 2026-01-02_

This guide turns a **finished VO MP3** + a **detailed script** into a **production-ready beat sheet** you can follow in CapCut (or any editor) with Arcanomy’s house style: **one claim → one receipt → one rule**, calm authority, and visual restraint.

> Core rule: **Text is a highlighter, not the script.**  
> Max **8–12 words** on screen, **1–2 lines**, **one emphasis** per beat.

---

## 1) Inputs (what you must have)
1) `vo.mp3` — finalized VO (already produced)
2) `script.md` — the spoken words (as written, with intended pauses)
3) Optional: `captions.srt` — autogenerated then cleaned (recommended)
4) Optional: 1–2 “receipts” — chart, stat card, or source screenshot

---

## 2) Output (what this guide produces)
A **beat sheet** with:
- **Timecodes** (start/end) aligned to the VO
- **Beat goal** (Hook / Frame / Receipt / Rule / Close)
- **On-screen text** (8–12 words max)
- **Visual** (b-roll / chart / typography frame)
- **Motion motif** (underline, receipt stamp, one-number freeze, margin note)
- **Audio notes** (silence, tick, marker, bed level)

---

## 3) The Arcanomy beat grammar (non‑negotiable)
Every reel must satisfy these three beats somewhere:
1) **Claim**: what you want the viewer to believe
2) **Receipt**: proof moment (stat, example, chart, visual evidence)
3) **Rule**: what to do instead (repeatable)

Default reel structure (45–75s):
- 0–2s Hook
- 2–15s Frame
- 15–45s Receipt
- 45–60s Rule
- 60–75s Optional identity stamp/close

---

## 4) Beat sheet workflow (do this every time)

### Step 1 — Create a “VO map” (first pass, no visuals)
Listen to `vo.mp3` once, and mark:
- **Hard stops** (full stop, long pause)
- **Pivot lines** (“So here’s what actually works”)
- **Numbers** (stats are your proof anchors)
- **Identity language** (rule + close)

Result: 8–14 beats for a 45–75s reel.

### Step 2 — Assign each beat a job
Each beat must be one of:
- **HOOK**: emotional truth / accusation / reframing
- **FRAME**: what they think vs what’s true
- **RECEIPT**: proof (stat, chart, example)
- **RULE**: repeatable action / identity stamp
- **CLOSE**: one-line landing / permission / “Any Tuesday.”

If a beat can’t be categorized, it’s probably unnecessary.

### Step 3 — Choose the visual mode per beat
Pick exactly one primary visual per beat:
- **Type-only** (clean plate / negative space)
- **B-roll** (literal but editorial; never cliché)
- **Chart/stat card** (the “receipt”)
- **Diagram** (rare; only if it clarifies)

Rule: **Don’t mix modes inside a single beat** unless you’re doing a deliberate “one-number freeze.”

### Step 4 — Write on-screen text (discipline)
For each beat, write **one** on-screen line:
- 8–12 words max
- 1–2 lines max
- Use **one** emphasized word/phrase (underline/circle)

If you need more words, your VO already has them. The screen is a highlighter.

### Step 5 — Assign 2–3 signature motifs (only)
Choose 2–3 motifs to repeat across the reel:
- **Underlined Claim**
- **Receipt Stamp**
- **One-Number Freeze**
- **Margin Notes**

Do **not** use all four in one reel.

### Step 6 — Decide where the “receipt” lives
Your reel needs a **clear proof moment**. Pick one:
- **Single stat freeze** (fastest)
- **Mini chart** (best if you have 2 values to compare)
- **Source screenshot** (works if you cite visually)

Rule: make the receipt visually obvious (stamp, label, or framing).

### Step 7 — Build the timeline (CapCut track plan)
Recommended track stack:
1) **VO** (locked)
2) **Music bed** (low; consistent)
3) **SFX** (ticks/marker only when meaning demands)
4) **Video layer** (b-roll/type frames/charts)
5) **Text overlays** (TYPE_XL/L/M/S presets)
6) **Markup overlays** (underline/circle/arrow)
7) **Optional plates** (only for legibility)

### Step 8 — QA pass (ship/no-ship)
- One claim? One receipt? One rule?
- Any frame with **>12 words**? Cut.
- More than **one accent color**? Fix.
- Any “template smell” motion (bounce/elastic/chaos)? Remove.
- Can a viewer repeat the rule in one sentence?

---

## 5) Timing & pacing defaults (so you don’t overthink)
- Average shot length: **0.8–1.8s**
- Proof beats can breathe: **2.0–3.5s**
- Max time with no visual change: **3.5s** (unless intentionally dramatic)
- Default text reveal: **240–320ms** (opacity + slight Y)
- Markup draw-on: **280–420ms**, slight delay after text appears

---

## 6) Visual cookbook (what to show when)

### Hook beats (0–5s)
**Goal:** stop the scroll with an accusation or unsettling truth  
**Best visuals:**
- Type-only (big, calm)
- Calendar pages / January imagery (editorial, not cheesy)
- Phone app screen b-roll (generic, not brand-specific)

**Motif:** Underlined Claim

### Frame beats (5–15s)
**Goal:** contrast belief vs reality  
**Best visuals:**
- Split-screen “belief vs truth”
- Minimal diagram (two columns)
- B-roll of “trying / restarting” (phone, notifications, list resets)

### Receipt beats (15–45s)
**Goal:** prove it  
**Best visuals:**
- One-number freeze for the strongest stat
- Mini comparison chart (two bars)
- Receipt stamp + margin note

### Rule beats (45–60s)
**Goal:** give the viewer a repeatable move  
**Best visuals:**
- Type-only with one emphasized phrase
- “Rule card” on a clean surface plate

### Close beats (60–75s)
**Goal:** emotional permission + identity landing  
**Best visuals:**
- Type-only, slower, more negative space
- A single symbolic b-roll shot (Tuesday morning, commute, coffee, desk)

## 7) Beat sheet template (copy/paste)
Use this table for every reel.

| # | Time | Beat Type | Spoken Line (VO) | On‑Screen Text (8–12 words) | Visual Mode | Motif | Notes |
|---:|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0:00–0:02 | HOOK |  |  | Type-only | Underline |  |
| 2 | 0:02–0:06 | FRAME |  |  | B-roll |  |  |
| 3 | 0:06–0:12 | RECEIPT |  |  | Stat freeze | One-number | tick SFX |

# 8) Example Beat Sheet — “Anti‑Resolution / Identity” (based on your script)
**Assumption:** total runtime ~60–70s with your pauses.  
**Instruction:** After you import `vo.mp3`, adjust these time ranges to match the waveform (the structure stays).

## Motifs used (limit to 3)
1) **Underlined Claim**
2) **One-Number Freeze**
3) **Receipt Stamp** (tiny, brief)

## Accent color plan
- Use **Amber** for emphasis (one accent per reel).
- Everything else neutral (Ink / Cloud / Beige).

## Beat sheet table (draft timecodes)
| # | Time | Beat Type | Spoken Line (VO) | On‑Screen Text (8–12 words) | Visual Mode | Motif | Notes |
|---:|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0:00–0:03 | HOOK | “By January nineteenth… four out of five… dead.” | **80% quit by Jan 19** | Type-only | Underline | Big TYPE_XL. Hold 0.3s before next cut. |
| 2 | 0:03–0:06 | FRAME | “Not because you’re lazy.” | It’s not laziness. | Type-only | — | Keep calm. No SFX. |
| 3 | 0:06–0:09 | FRAME | “Because the game is rigged.” | The game is rigged. | Type-only or B-roll | Underline | Underline “rigged.” Soft whoosh optional, very low. |
| 4 | 0:09–0:15 | RECEIPT | “91%… abandon… within 30 days.” | **91% abandon in 30 days** | Stat card / mini chart | One-number | One-number freeze on “91%” for 0.3s. Tick SFX. |
| 5 | 0:15–0:19 | FRAME | “That’s not a willpower problem. That’s a design problem.” | Not willpower. **Design.** | Type-only | — | Emphasize “Design.” with amber underline. |
| 6 | 0:19–0:27 | FRAME | “Miss a day… reset… start over…” | The **reset loop** is the product. | B-roll (phone/app) | — | Show notification → “missed day” → reset feel. Keep text minimal. |
| 7 | 0:27–0:33 | PIVOT | “So here’s what actually works…” | What works instead: **identity** | Type-only | Receipt Stamp | Tiny “RECEIPT” stamp appears briefly to signal shift to proof. |
| 8 | 0:33–0:40 | RECEIPT | “Save $500… wins 47%…” | Outcome goals: **47%** | Mini comparison chart | One-number | Two bars: 47 vs 59. Highlight 47 first. |
| 9 | 0:40–0:48 | RECEIPT | “I pay myself first… 59%.” | Identity framing: **59%** | Same chart | One-number | Highlight flips to 59. Margin note: “harder to ‘fail’.” |
|10 | 0:48–0:53 | RULE | “One can fail. The other keeps compounding.” | Identity compounds. | Type-only | Underline | Underline “compounds.” Let it breathe. |
|11 | 0:53–0:60 | RULE | “Every small action is a vote…” | Small actions = votes for **future you** | B-roll (quiet routine) | — | Morning deposit / calendar / simple habit. |
|12 | 0:60–0:66 | CLOSE | “Not January first. Any Tuesday.” | Any Tuesday. | Type-only | — | Hard cut to calm negative space. |
|13 | 0:66–0:72 | CLOSE | “Real change doesn’t need permission.” | No calendar permission required. | Type-only | Underline | Final underline on “permission.” Fade out. |

## 9) Asset checklist for this specific reel
### Must-have
- `vo.mp3`
- **Stat cards** (clean, minimal):
  - “80% quit by Jan 19” (if you choose to show it)
  - “91% abandon in 30 days”
  - “47% vs 59%” comparison

### Nice-to-have b-roll (pick 6–10 shots, 1–2s each)
- Calendar pages / January visual (subtle)
- Phone home screen with app buried / notifications
- “Reset” metaphor: checkbox undone, streak broken
- Simple habit visuals: bank app deposit, auto-transfer confirmation
- Tuesday morning: commute, desk, coffee, laptop glow

### Design notes
- Keep b-roll **desaturated / editorial**.
- Avoid cliché finance imagery (piggy banks, dollar signs).

## 10) Caption strategy (fast, non-overwhelming)
Use **captions for accessibility**, but keep them restrained:
- Captions on bottom, 1–2 lines
- Do **not** caption every pause with extra filler
- Your **overlay text** is only for hook/stat/rule

Practical approach:
1) Auto-caption → clean obvious errors
2) Ensure key numbers render correctly: “91%”, “30 days”, “47%”, “59%”
3) Do **not** add extra emphasis styling to every line

---

## 11) Sound mix (quick defaults)
- VO: clear and dominant
- Bed: low and steady (70–95 BPM)
- SFX: only for “number moments” (tick/marker), very low

Moments to place SFX:
- Beat 4: tick on “91%”
- Beat 8–9: marker/underline draw for 47% → 59%
- Optional: tiny stamp sound on “RECEIPT” label (beat 7)

---

## 12) Final QA (ship / no‑ship)
- Can you summarize the reel in one sentence?
- Is the **receipt visually obvious**?
- Is the **rule repeatable**?
- Any frame with too much text? Reduce.
- Does it feel **premium** (restraint, spacing, calm)?

If any answer is “no,” it doesn’t ship.
