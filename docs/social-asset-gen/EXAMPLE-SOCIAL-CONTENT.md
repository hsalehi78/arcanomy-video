## Post 1
The anti-resolution mindset isn't about giving up on goals.
It's about rejecting the arbitrary January 1st deadline.

## Post 2
January 1st financial goals fail because they're calendar-driven, not behavior-driven.

Most people quit by February.

Not because they're weak. Because the system is broken.

The best time to start was yesterday. The second best time is today.

Not January 1st. Today.

# Reel Scripts

## Reel: permission-trap
**Claim:** FIRE isn't about retiring early. It's about owning your time.
**Why It Matters:** Most people wait for permission to live the life they want.
**Emotion Target:** Aha
**Remembered Sentence:** You don't need permission to start.

**Script:**
Everyone thinks FIRE is about quitting your job.
It's not.
FIRE is about reaching a point where work becomes optional.
The goal isn't to stop working forever.
It's to stop working for permission.
Permission to take the trip.
Permission to say no to the meeting.
Permission to spend Tuesday however you want.
The number isn't the goal.
Freedom is.

## Reel: four-percent-math
**Claim:** $1M at 4% = $40K/year forever.
**Why It Matters:** Simple math that changes everything.
**Emotion Target:** OMG
**Remembered Sentence:** That's freedom math.

**Script:**
Here's the math that changes everything.
One million dollars.
Four percent withdrawal rate.
That's forty thousand dollars a year.
Forever.
Not for ten years. Forever.
The 4% rule says you can withdraw 4% of your portfolio each year.
And statistically, you'll never run out.
So the question isn't "how much do I need?"
It's "what's 4% of enough?"
That's freedom math.
