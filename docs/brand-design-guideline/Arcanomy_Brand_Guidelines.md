# Arcanomy Brand Guidelines v1.0
_Last updated: 2025-12-30_

This is the **single source of truth** for what “Arcanomy” is and how it must show up—on the website, in emails, on social, and in video.

---

## 0) What Arcanomy Is

### Brand promise
**Where Knowledge Builds Wealth.**

Arcanomy makes money feel **understandable** and **actionable**—without condescension, hype, or cringe.

### Who it’s for
FIRE-minded people (and “FIRE-curious” readers) who want:
- clarity over complexity
- truth over vibes
- optionality over consumption

### Positioning
**NerdWallet polish** + **wealth psychology** + **editorial taste**.  
Not “finance influencer.” Not “bro hustle.” Not “generic explainers.”

---

## 1) Voice & Writing

### Voice pillars (non‑negotiable)
- **Smart:** evidence-based, numerate, grounded.
- **Human:** speaks like a wise friend; never cold, never robotic.
- **Empowering:** no shame; the reader always leaves stronger.
- **Bold:** you make claims—but you earn them.

### Voice rules
**Do**
- Use crisp, concrete sentences.
- Use “you” and “we” to create proximity.
- Teach → show → apply.

**Avoid**
- “game changer,” “unlock,” “crush your goals,” “hack,” “masterclass,” “level up”
- moralizing (“you should feel guilty”) or lecturing
- corporate filler (“synergies,” “leveraging,” “stakeholders”)

### Copy rhythm (default)
- **Headline:** sharp claim
- **Lede:** emotional truth (1–3 lines)
- **Proof:** one receipt (data, math, example)
- **Takeaway:** one repeatable rule

---

## 2) Visual Identity

### 2.1 Logo
> Placeholders until the final mark exists.

**Allowed versions**
- Full logo (wordmark + mark)
- Wordmark only
- Mark only (favicons, app icons)

**Clearspace**
- Minimum clearspace = height of the “A” in Arcanomy around all sides

**Do not**
- stretch, skew, outline, add drop shadows
- place on busy imagery
- recolor outside the palette

---

## 2.2 Color system (final tokens)
This palette is **locked** and serves as the canonical source of truth.

### Core palette (Arcanomy)
- **Primary:** `#A47864` (Brand anchors, emphasis)
- **Background:** `#3A3A3A` (Dark void, never pure black)
- **Text:** `#EAEAEA` (Neutral text)
- **Receipt Paper:** `#FDF5E6` (Paper texture)
- **Blue:** `#0056A3` (Source/info tags)
- **Green:** `#046A38` (Win/positive delta)

### Token mapping (Default / Video)
| Token | Hex | Use |
|---|---:|---|
| `--bg` | `#3A3A3A` | Page/Video background (Dark void) |
| `--surface` | `#FDF5E6` | Receipt cards/panels (Light paper) |
| `--text` | `#EAEAEA` | Primary text on dark background |
| `--text-inverse` | `#3A3A3A` | Text on Receipt Paper |
| `--primary` | `#A47864` | Primary CTAs, brand anchors, emphasis |
| `--blue` | `#0056A3` | Info tags, sources |
| `--success` | `#046A38` | Positive delta, wins |

### Usage rules (non‑negotiable)
- **Primary is for "Trust + Emphasis."** (Anchors, underlines, key actions.)
- **Background is always `#3A3A3A`.** Never use pure black `#000000`.
- **Receipt Paper** is for proof moments (charts, stats, cards).

## 2.3 Typography
**Headings:** Lora  
**Body:** Montserrat

### Typography rules
- Prefer **fewer weights** (2–3 max) to avoid “template noise.”
- Use strong hierarchy: H1 must feel decisive.
- Tighten line lengths: 60–80 chars desktop; 35–45 mobile.

### Default type scale (recommended)
| Style | Size | Weight | Line-height |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| H1 | 40–48 | 600–700 | 1.05–1.15 |
| H2 | 28–34 | 600–700 | 1.15 |
| H3 | 22–26 | 600 | 1.2 |
| Body | 16–18 | 400–500 | 1.5–1.65 |
| Small | 13–14 | 400–500 | 1.45 |

---

## 2.4 Iconography
- Use a single icon family.
- Prefer **outline** icons with consistent stroke width.
- Icons are supporting actors—never the headline.

---

## 3) Imagery

### Image vibe
**Serious, emotionally grounded, editorial.**  
Images should feel like: choice, tradeoffs, pressure, relief, freedom, consequence.

### Banned imagery (hard no)
- piggy banks, dollar-sign cartoons, “stock handshake,” exploding graphs
- shocked faces / “YouTube thumbnail” expressions
- busy collages and meme templates

### Overlaid text policy
- **Website/blog:** no text on photography.
- **Video:** minimal typography overlays allowed (see Motion Guide).

---

## 4) Data Visuals (Charts)
Charts are “receipts.” They must look calm, legible, and intentional.

Rules
- light gridlines, strong axes
- label what matters; remove what doesn’t
- highlight a single point with a single accent color

---

## 5) Tone by medium (quick mapping)

| Medium | Default tone | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Website articles | calm authority | teach → show → apply |
| Calculators | practical clarity | reduce anxiety; make next steps obvious |
| Email | intimate + direct | one sharp idea; minimal fluff |
| Social posts | provocative but earned | no clickbait voice |
| Reels | evidence-first explainer | one claim; one receipt; one rule |

---



## 5.5 Social platform guidelines (visual + voice)
These rules prevent “random creator energy.”

### Profile aesthetic (Instagram / TikTok / X)
- Avatar: **Mark-only** (high contrast, no tiny wordmark).
- Bio: 1 sentence promise + 1 proof cue + 1 CTA.
  - Example format:  
    **Where Knowledge Builds Wealth.** Wealth psychology + FIRE clarity. → link
- Grid: calm, consistent, evidence-first.
  - Default mix: **70% reels / 20% carousels / 10% stills**  
  - Quote graphics are rare (only for “rule” posts).

### Highlight covers (IG)
- Single icon style, `Text` on `Background`, optional `Primary` accent.
- Labels: 1 word max.

### Story templates
- One background (`Background` or `Receipt Paper`) + `Text` (ensure contrast).
- One accent use max (`Primary`).
- Minimal stickers. Avoid “busy creator UI.”

### Comment voice (non-negotiable)
- Calm, direct, slightly witty.
- Never defensive. Never “engagement bait.”
- If challenged: acknowledge → clarify → give receipt → exit.

### Cross-posting strategy (default)
Same core reel across platforms, but:
- **TikTok:** faster hook; captions more literal.
- **IG:** cleaner typography; less text overall.
- **X:** post the claim + one stat + link; pin the best performing.

### Captions (rules)
- 1–2 short paragraphs max.
- One question at the end only if it’s real (not bait).
- Hashtags optional; if used, 3–6 max.

## 6) Quality Gate (ship/no-ship)
Before publishing anything, ask:

1) Does it feel **premium** or **template**?  
2) Is the claim **earned**?  
3) Is the vibe **human** (not corporate, not influencer)?  
4) Would a smart friend be proud to share it?

If any answer is “no,” it doesn’t ship.

---

## 8) Failure examples (what “bad” looks like)
These aren’t “avoid lists.” These are **do-not-ship patterns**.

### A) Generic finance cliché
**Looks like:** piggy bank, dollar-sign icons, cartoon graphs, smiling stock photos.  
**Why it fails:** screams “cheap finance content.”  
**Fix:** use editorial photography (pressure, choice, consequence) or a clean chart.

### B) Template smell UI
**Looks like:** symmetrical SaaS hero, 3 feature cards, gradient background, too many chips/badges.  
**Why it fails:** feels like a template, not authority.  
**Fix:** tighten hierarchy, reduce color, increase whitespace, sharpen the claim.

### C) Over-kinetic explainer type
**Looks like:** text flying in every beat, bouncing easing, too many words per frame.  
**Why it fails:** reads as “explainer spam.”  
**Fix:** use 2–3 motifs only: underline, receipt stamp, one-number freeze.

### D) Audio mismatch
**Looks like:** epic trailer builds, EDM drops, loud whooshes.  
**Why it fails:** breaks calm authority.  
**Fix:** downtempo bed + minimal marker/tick SFX.

### E) Too many claims
**Looks like:** one reel tries to teach 4 ideas in 60s.  
**Why it fails:** nothing sticks.  
**Fix:** split into two reels. One claim per reel.

## 7) Governance
- This document is the truth. Playbooks implement it.
- Update policy: changes must be intentional and logged (v1.1, v1.2…).


## 9) Visual Examples (required)
Words are not enough. This section defines the **gold standard reference set** that everyone must match.

### 9.1 Website screenshots (3–5)
**How to capture**
- Desktop: 1440px wide
- Mobile: 390×844 viewport
- Save as PNG, no browser UI

**Required set**
| File | What it shows | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `examples/web/home-desktop.png` | Home page above the fold | hierarchy + brand |
| `examples/web/article-desktop.png` | Article page (lede + section headers) | typography rhythm |
| `examples/web/calculator-mobile.png` | Calculator (cards + inputs + chart) | mobile-first proof |
| `examples/web/article-mobile.png` | Article mobile view | spacing + readability |
| `examples/web/nav-footer.png` | Nav + footer | system consistency |

### 9.2 Reel stills (3–5)
Pull frames from finished reels.

| File | Frame | What it proves |
|---|---|---|
| `examples/motion/hook.png` | Hook frame | TYPE_XL discipline + motif |
| `examples/motion/receipt.png` | Receipt moment | chart style + markup |
| `examples/motion/one-number-freeze.png` | Key stat | emphasis without hype |
| `examples/motion/rule.png` | Rule frame | repeatable takeaway |
| `examples/motion/broll-overlay.png` | B-roll + text | restraint + legibility |

### 9.3 “This vs That” comparison
Create one comparison image:
- Left: Arcanomy frame (calm, minimal, 1 accent, 8–12 words max)
- Right: Generic explainer frame (hyper-kinetic, many colors, too much text)

Save as:
- `examples/this-vs-that/arcanomy-vs-generic.png`
