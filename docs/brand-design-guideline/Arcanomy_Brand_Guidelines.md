# Arcanomy Brand Guidelines v1.0
_Last updated: 2025-12-30_

This is the **single source of truth** for what “Arcanomy” is and how it must show up—on the website, in emails, on social, and in video.

---

## 0) What Arcanomy Is

### Brand promise
**Where Knowledge Builds Wealth.**

Arcanomy makes money feel **understandable** and **actionable**—without condescension, hype, or cringe.

### Who it’s for
FIRE-minded people (and “FIRE-curious” readers) who want:
- clarity over complexity
- truth over vibes
- optionality over consumption

### Positioning
**NerdWallet polish** + **wealth psychology** + **editorial taste**.  
Not “finance influencer.” Not “bro hustle.” Not “generic explainers.”

---

## 1) Voice & Writing

### Voice pillars (non‑negotiable)
- **Smart:** evidence-based, numerate, grounded.
- **Human:** speaks like a wise friend; never cold, never robotic.
- **Empowering:** no shame; the reader always leaves stronger.
- **Bold:** you make claims—but you earn them.

### Voice rules
**Do**
- Use crisp, concrete sentences.
- Use “you” and “we” to create proximity.
- Teach → show → apply.

**Avoid**
- “game changer,” “unlock,” “crush your goals,” “hack,” “masterclass,” “level up”
- moralizing (“you should feel guilty”) or lecturing
- corporate filler (“synergies,” “leveraging,” “stakeholders”)

### Copy rhythm (default)
- **Headline:** sharp claim
- **Lede:** emotional truth (1–3 lines)
- **Proof:** one receipt (data, math, example)
- **Takeaway:** one repeatable rule

---

## 2) Visual Identity

### 2.1 Logo
> Placeholders until the final mark exists.

**Allowed versions**
- Full logo (wordmark + mark)
- Wordmark only
- Mark only (favicons, app icons)

**Clearspace**
- Minimum clearspace = height of the “A” in Arcanomy around all sides

**Do not**
- stretch, skew, outline, add drop shadows
- place on busy imagery
- recolor outside the palette

---

## 2.2 Color system (tokens)
Your palette should feel **premium, calm, and trustworthy**. Avoid neon, overly-saturated gradients, and “fintech slime.”

**How to use color**
- Most pages should be **neutral-driven** (ink, paper, stone).
- Accent color is for **meaning**, not decoration (primary actions, highlights, key data).

### Recommended token set
> Replace values with your finalized “Coco Babe” palette values. Keep the structure.

| Token | Usage | Sample value (replace) |
|---|---|---|
| `--bg` | page background | `#0B0F1A` or `#FFFFFF` |
| `--surface` | cards, panels | `#111827` / `#F7F7F9` |
| `--text` | primary text | `#E5E7EB` / `#0B0F1A` |
| `--muted-text` | secondary text | `#A1A1AA` / `#52525B` |
| `--border` | separators | `#1F2937` / `#E5E7EB` |
| `--primary` | CTAs, links | (your primary) |
| `--primary-ink` | text on primary | auto contrast |
| `--accent` | highlights, emphasis | (your accent) |
| `--danger` | errors | (your red) |
| `--success` | confirmations | (your green) |

## 2.3 Typography
**Headings:** Lora  
**Body:** Montserrat

### Typography rules
- Prefer **fewer weights** (2–3 max) to avoid “template noise.”
- Use strong hierarchy: H1 must feel decisive.
- Tighten line lengths: 60–80 chars desktop; 35–45 mobile.

### Default type scale (recommended)
| Style | Size | Weight | Line-height |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| H1 | 40–48 | 600–700 | 1.05–1.15 |
| H2 | 28–34 | 600–700 | 1.15 |
| H3 | 22–26 | 600 | 1.2 |
| Body | 16–18 | 400–500 | 1.5–1.65 |
| Small | 13–14 | 400–500 | 1.45 |

---

## 2.4 Iconography
- Use a single icon family.
- Prefer **outline** icons with consistent stroke width.
- Icons are supporting actors—never the headline.

---

## 3) Imagery

### Image vibe
**Serious, emotionally grounded, editorial.**  
Images should feel like: choice, tradeoffs, pressure, relief, freedom, consequence.

### Banned imagery (hard no)
- piggy banks, dollar-sign cartoons, “stock handshake,” exploding graphs
- shocked faces / “YouTube thumbnail” expressions
- busy collages and meme templates

### Overlaid text policy
- **Website/blog:** no text on photography.
- **Video:** minimal typography overlays allowed (see Motion Guide).

---

## 4) Data Visuals (Charts)
Charts are “receipts.” They must look calm, legible, and intentional.

Rules
- light gridlines, strong axes
- label what matters; remove what doesn’t
- highlight a single point with a single accent color

---

## 5) Tone by medium (quick mapping)

| Medium | Default tone | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Website articles | calm authority | teach → show → apply |
| Calculators | practical clarity | reduce anxiety; make next steps obvious |
| Email | intimate + direct | one sharp idea; minimal fluff |
| Social posts | provocative but earned | no clickbait voice |
| Reels | evidence-first explainer | one claim; one receipt; one rule |

---

## 6) Quality Gate (ship/no-ship)
Before publishing anything, ask:

1) Does it feel **premium** or **template**?  
2) Is the claim **earned**?  
3) Is the vibe **human** (not corporate, not influencer)?  
4) Would a smart friend be proud to share it?

If any answer is “no,” it doesn’t ship.

---

## 7) Governance
- This document is the truth. Playbooks implement it.
- Update policy: changes must be intentional and logged (v1.1, v1.2…).
