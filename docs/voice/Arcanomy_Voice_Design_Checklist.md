# Arcanomy Voice Design Checklist (Run Once)

□ Read the Voice Design Kit fully
□ Generate candidates using the mandatory audition script
□ Score each voice objectively (no vibes)
□ Select exactly 2 voices (A + B)
□ Fill `voice-registry.json` with final voice IDs
□ Lock voices for at least 50 videos
□ Stop thinking about voices

If you are still debating after this checklist, you are over-optimizing.
