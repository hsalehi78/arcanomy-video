# Arcanomy Voice Design Kit v1.0
_Last updated: 2026-01-01_

This document defines **how Arcanomy designs, auditions, selects, and governs narrator voices**.
It is a **brand-level artifact**, not part of daily production.

---

## 0) Purpose (why this exists)

Voice is authority.

This kit ensures:
- consistency across all Arcanomy explainers
- no drift toward influencer, hype, or character acting
- ElevenLabs v3 is used deliberately, not experimentally

Voice decisions are made **once**, reviewed occasionally, and otherwise left alone.

---

## 1) Voice architecture (locked)

Arcanomy uses **two narrator voices**, both male, General American accent.

### Voice A — Primary Narrator (“Calm Prosecutor”)
- Usage: **default (90%+)**
- Function: indictment, explanation, rule-setting
- Personality: controlled, skeptical, evidence-first


#############################################################################
PASTE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK IN ELEVEN LABS: Arcanomy-A Voice
---
Male narrator, late 30s–40s, General American accent.

Weary, cynical, and DRY.
Low warmth.
Low friendliness.

Sounds like an investigative journalist who has not slept.
Carries quiet exhaustion from following a long-running fraud.
Slightly gravelly texture.
Lower pitch and grounded weight.

Calm but not kind.
Authoritative without reassurance.
Understated irritation beneath the surface.

Never warm.
Never friendly.
Never bright.
Never upbeat.
Never forgiving.

Not a presenter.
Not a host.
Not a narrator for training content.

Reads lists with fatigue and disdain, as if the tactics are obvious and insulting.
Delivers conclusions like warnings, not facts.

Speaks as someone who already knows the system is rigged.
The listener is catching up.

### Voice B — Secondary Narrator (“Measured Analyst”)
- Usage: **limited (≤10%)**
- Function: reflective, zoom-out, fatigue reduction
- Personality: calmer, slightly warmer, still restrained

❌ No female narrator voices in v1 (reserved for future series or interviews).

PASTE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK IN ELEVEN LABS: Arcanomy-B Voice
----
Male narrator, late 30s–40s, General American accent.

Calm, thoughtful, and slightly weary.
Measured and analytical, with quiet skepticism.
Sounds like a long-form investigative analyst explaining context.

Moderate pacing with natural variation.
Clear articulation.
Subtle fatigue from experience, not emotion.

Never dramatic.
Never upbeat.
Never casual.

Not a storyteller.
Not a guide.
Not comforting.

Speaks as someone zooming out after years of watching incentives fail.
Maintains authority without sharp edges.

## 2) Accent + delivery constraints

**Accent:** General American only  
**Tone:** calm authority, never hype  
**Cadence:** brisk but controlled  
**Emotion:** restrained; no theatrics  
**Energy:** institutional, not influencer

Avoid:
- announcer voice
- podcast intimacy
- motivational warmth
- dramatic acting
- sarcasm as performance

---

## 3) Mandatory audition script (use for ALL voices)

Every candidate voice is tested with the same script.
No exceptions.

```
Most people think January is motivation season.
It’s not.

It’s sales season.

Because companies don’t profit when you succeed.
They profit when you RESET.

Miss a day.
Feel behind.
Start again.

That feeling?
That’s the business model.
```

Why this script:
- neutral opening
- hard twist
- stacked mechanism
- indictment close

If a voice fails here, it will fail everywhere.

---

## 4) Candidate generation rules

### Sources
- ElevenLabs **library voices**
- ElevenLabs **Voice Design v3**

### Volume
- Generate **8–12 total candidates**
  - 4–6 aimed at Voice A
  - 3–5 aimed at Voice B

Do not over-generate. Decision fatigue degrades judgment.

---

## 5) Voice Design v3 prompt (baseline)

Use this prompt verbatim as a starting point:

> Male, 30s–40s, General American accent. Calm authority with subtle skepticism. Tight pacing, crisp consonants, low vocal fry. Sounds like a premium explainer narrator—confident, controlled, never salesy, never theatrical. Micro-pauses before reveals.

For Voice B only, add:
> Slightly warmer, slower micro-cadence, but still restrained.

---

## 6) Scoring rubric (brutal, objective)

Score each voice from **0–5** on each axis.

| Criterion | Description |
|---------|------------|
| Authority without hype | Feels credible without sounding promotional |
| Stress accuracy | Emphasis lands on the correct word |
| Under-acting | Does not “perform” or dramatize |
| Consistency | Similar tone across takes |
| Comp-friendliness | Easy to splice line-by-line |
| Mobile clarity | Clear at phone speaker volume |
| Arcanomy fit | Feels premium, restrained, institutional |

**Passing rule:**  
- Voice A must score **≥30 / 35**  
- Voice B must score **≥27 / 35**

Anything below is rejected permanently.

---

## 7) Selection rules

- Pick **one** Voice A and **one** Voice B
- Do NOT keep backups “just in case”
- Commit for a minimum of **50 published videos** before reconsideration

Consistency beats marginal gains.

---

## 8) Usage rules (non-negotiable)

- One voice per video
- Never mix voices inside a reel
- Voice A is default unless explicitly justified
- Voice B is never used for sharp indictments
- Voice identity is never mentioned on-screen or in copy

---

## 9) Re-evaluation policy

Revisit voice design only if:
- ElevenLabs v3 materially changes synthesis quality
- Arcanomy launches a new content vertical
- Audience scale justifies human VO

Otherwise: **do not touch voices**.

---

## 10) Success test

If viewers:
- remember the idea, not the voice
- trust the explanation
- feel clarity instead of performance

The voice is doing its job.
