[matter-of-fact] By January nineteenth…
[short pause] four out of five New Year’s resolutions are already dead.

[short pause][dry] Not because you’re lazy.
[short pause][cold] Because the game is rigged.

[long pause][matter-of-fact] In January, ninety-one percent of people who download a finance app…
[short pause] abandon it within thirty days.

[short pause][cold] That’s not a willpower problem.
[short pause][dry] That’s a design problem.

[short pause] Miss a day…
[short pause] and the app turns it into a RESET.
[short pause] You feel behind.
[short pause] You “start over.”
[short pause][dry] And every restart feels like progress… without results.

[long pause][matter-of-fact] So here’s what actually works:
[short pause] stop chasing outcomes.
[short pause] start building identity.

[short pause][matter-of-fact] “Save five hundred dollars a month” —
[short pause] about a forty-seven percent success rate.

[short pause][matter-of-fact] But “I’m the kind of person who pays myself first” —
[short pause] about fifty-nine percent.

[short pause][dry] Because one can fail.
[short pause][closing argument] The other just keeps compounding.

[long pause][matter-of-fact] Every small action is a vote for who you’re becoming.
[short pause] And you can cast that vote any day.

[short pause][dry] Not January first.
[short pause] Any Tuesday.

[long pause][cold] Real change doesn’t need a calendar’s permission.
