By January nineteenth…
four out of five New Year’s resolutions are already dead.

Not because you’re lazy.
Because the game is rigged.

In January, ninety-one percent of people who download a finance app…
abandon it within thirty days.

That’s not a willpower problem.
That’s a design problem.

If you miss a day, the app turns it into a reset.
You feel behind.
You “start over.”
And every restart feels like progress… without results.

So here’s what actually works:
Stop chasing outcomes.
Start building identity.

“Save five hundred dollars a month” works sometimes.
It wins about forty-seven percent of the time.

But “I’m the kind of person who pays myself first” wins more.
About fifty-nine percent.

Because one can fail.
The other just keeps compounding.

Every small action is a vote for who you’re becoming.
And you can cast that vote any day.

Not January first.
Any Tuesday.

Real change doesn’t need a calendar’s permission.
