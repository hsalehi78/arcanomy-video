this is what you wrote before, Budget gyms sell thousands of memberships per location.
Actual capacity? A few hundred people at once.
If everyone showed up regularly, the math breaks.
The building can't hold them. The equipment can't serve them.
So they charge $10 a month and make cancellation annoying.
In-person visits. Mailed letters. Buried phone numbers.
At ten bucks, the hassle of canceling beats the hassle of paying.
January joiners churn faster than people who sign up any other month.
The gyms know this. They price for it.
Half of new members quit within six months.
Americans waste billions on memberships they never use.
You're not buying fitness. You're buying a story you won't have to finish.
Your guilt pays the rent.
They're betting you won't show up.
